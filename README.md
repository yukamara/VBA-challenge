# VBA-challenge

This was my first real coding assignment. The bonus part was particularly challenging for me. The bonus tasks were a bit more challenging for me, even though I tried my best, I was unable to get my code to perform the bonus task as required. I tried several different code options, I submitted the one that gave me what was closest to what I was looking for.
